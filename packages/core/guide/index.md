# TCPIOneer Guide

## Introduction
Welcome to _TCPIOneer_, an API that can serve as a **remote-desktop host** controlled via **HTTP endpoints**.

In this document is a guide on:

* Guide directory
* Authentication
* Session lifecycle
* Commands
* [Desktop Control API](/guide/capabilities)
* Endpoints

This document should be able to guide you through operating TCPIOneer, whether you're a human, LLM, or anything with HTTP.

## Guide Directory

This is the main guide file. For extra information on endpoints or concepts, refer to this directory for locations.

Every link in this multi-level list does **not** need authentication to access.

* [Guide](/guide)
* * Endpoints
* * * [Request Session (/request-session)](/guide/endpoints/request-session)
* * Capabilities

## Authentication
Authentication in TCPIOneer is essential when you need to access endpoints related to remote desktop.

### Getting a Token
A token must be given to you by a server operator. Without an auth token, you **cannot** access the remote desktop endpoints.

If you have a token, using it is simple. To use a token, place it in the `Authorization` header as a `Bearer` token.

Example:
```
GET /api/v1/request-session HTTP/1.1
[other headers...]
Authorization: Bearer abcd1234
```

A valid token authenticates the request, but does not by itself guarantee
that the requested operation will be accepted. Session state, capabilities,
and server policy may also affect whether a request is permitted.

> **IMPORTANT:** If a server operator needs to rotate a token, it's best to do so through TCPIOneer's CLI options rather than editing `config.json` manually, since cryptographic random generation is built into TCPIOneer.

## Session Lifecycle
Sessions are the **authorization context** used to access the remote desktop, and **without them, you cannot use the remote desktop**. 

One client is not bound to one session; **a client may have multiple sessions**.

This can also go the other way. **Sessions can be utilized by more than one client** if they possess the **session key** for the session.

> Sharing a session key with multiple clients is **not recommended** unless all clients are coordinated, because all clients with the key share access to the session.

Sessions are built to **only live for as long as they are used**.
Sessions **must** be removed if unused, since servers often have a maximum session limit. (see [Session Deletion](#session-deletion))

Here's a graph showing you what this lifecycle looks like (left to right):

```
graph LR
a["Session Request"]
b{"Permitted?"}
c(["End"])
d["Session Creation"]
e["Session Usage"]
f["Session Deletion"]

a --> b
b -- "No" --> c
b -- "Yes" --> d
d --> e
e --> e
e -- End of usage --> f
f --> c
```

### Session Requesting

When you request for a session in TCPIOneer, the server ensures that you are able to create a new session. The server would give you a session key if the server allows the session to be created.

If the server prohibits you from creating a session, it will return an HTTP error in the response depending on what went wrong (see [Request Session (/request-session)](/guide/endpoints/request-session)).

#### Session Key

A session key is a UUID that is randomly generated for your session. This key is used to select your session and to verify you are authorized to use it.

A session key identifies and authorizes access to a session; it does not authenticate the client as the original session creator.

### Session Usage

To use a session key, place it in the `Session` key of JSON POST endpoints.

Example:
```json
{
    "data": {
        // ...
    },
    "session": "xxxxxxxx-xxxx-4xxx-yxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx" // (your session key)
}
```

### Session Deletion

When a session is deleted, **it CAN NOT be used anymore**.
A session **MUST** be deleted when:

* It does not need to be used anymore
* The client times out
* The server needs the session to be deleted

A session may be deleted by the server or the client, though the difference is that the client can only **request** the server to delete the session; the server can **force** the deletion of a session at any time, since the server hosts the session. Though, it is the server's responsibility to inform the client about a session deletion when a client requests for it.

The client will discover a session deletion on the next attempt to use it and **must** stop attempts to use the session key.

## Desktop Control

Authenticated clients can send mouse and keyboard actions and request screenshots through the [Desktop Control API](/guide/capabilities). These routes provide direct desktop input and screen access, so keep the server private and use a strong token.

## Endpoints

> Specific endpoint help can be found as children in Endpoints (see [Guide Directory](#guide-directory)).
> This section is for general endpoint info.

Endpoints are the ways to access the TCPIOneer API, and any other HTTP API you will ever look at.

### Common Issues

If you're having issues with endpoints, try checking the following:

* You are using the proper authentication to use the endpoint
* Your request is not malformed
* The reason of the error (might include more information on the error)

Make sure to check these before sending a bug report.
